## Script

1. MrBeast's janitor just revealed he's secretly a millionaire.
2. And no, this isn't some feel-good charity stunt—this guy actually enjoys mopping floors.
3. Three days ago, he went on a podcast and casually dropped that he's worth eight figures.
4. Everyone assumed he was broke, living paycheck to paycheck like most of us.
5. But here's the real question: why would a millionaire choose to clean toilets?
6. He told MrBeast to keep his raise, threw his mop on the ground, and walked out mid-shift.
7. The entire room went silent. Even MrBeast didn't know what to say.
8. Subscribe if you would quit your job this dramatically.

## Quality Targets

- **Max Dead Air:** 0.3 seconds between cuts
- **Retention Target:** 90%+
- **First Frame:** Must be eye-catching hook visual
- **Captions:** Required, large, high contrast

## Editor Notes

**Hook Placement:** First 3 seconds must have strongest visual. Use most eye-catching asset.

**Mid-Spike:** Line 5-6 (setup to payoff) - add visual energy spike

**Loop Close:** Connect ending back to opening hook visually
